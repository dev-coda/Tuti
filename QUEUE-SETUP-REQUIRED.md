# ⚠️ QUEUE CONFIGURATION REQUIRED FOR INVENTORY SYNC

## Problem

The inventory sync feature requires **asynchronous job processing** to avoid PHP execution timeouts. If you're seeing this error:

```
Fatal error: Maximum execution time of 30+2 seconds exceeded 
in vendor/guzzlehttp/guzzle/src/Handler/CurlHandler.php
```

It means your queue is configured to run **synchronously** instead of **asynchronously**.

## Solution

### 1. Update .env File

Change your `.env` file from:
```env
QUEUE_CONNECTION=sync
```

To:
```env
QUEUE_CONNECTION=database
```

### 2. Run Migrations

Ensure the jobs table exists:
```bash
php artisan migrate
```

This will create the `jobs` and `failed_jobs` tables if they don't exist.

### 3. Start Queue Worker

**For Development:**
```bash
php artisan queue:work database --sleep=3 --tries=3
```
Keep this terminal open. The worker will process jobs as they arrive.

**For Production (using Supervisor):**

See `README-QUEUE.md` for complete supervisor setup instructions.

## Why This is Required

The inventory sync:
- Fetches data from multiple bodegas (warehouses)
- Makes SOAP API calls that can take 20-30 seconds each
- Processes and updates hundreds of products
- **Total time can exceed 5 minutes**

When `QUEUE_CONNECTION=sync`:
- Jobs run in the same web request
- Hit PHP's 30-second execution limit
- Cause timeout errors

When `QUEUE_CONNECTION=database` + queue worker running:
- Jobs run in background process
- Have their own execution time limits (300 seconds configured)
- Don't block web requests
- Return immediately to user

## Verify Queue is Working

1. Check if queue worker is running:
```bash
ps aux | grep "queue:work"
```

2. Check pending jobs:
```bash
php artisan queue:failed
```

3. Monitor jobs table:
```bash
php artisan tinker
>>> DB::table('jobs')->count()
```

## Master Branch Configuration

The master branch works because it has:
- ✅ `QUEUE_CONNECTION=database` in .env
- ✅ Queue worker running in background
- ✅ Jobs processed asynchronously

## Quick Fix Checklist

- [ ] Changed `QUEUE_CONNECTION=database` in .env
- [ ] Ran `php artisan migrate`
- [ ] Started queue worker: `php artisan queue:work database`
- [ ] Tested inventory sync - should return immediately with "iniciada" message
- [ ] Verified jobs are being processed in background
